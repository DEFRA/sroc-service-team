# TCM - Schedule

This covers the schedule process for the [Tactical Charging Module](https://github.com/DEFRA/sroc-tcm-admin).

- [Agree date and time for release](#agree-date-and-time-for-release)
- [Submit RfC](#submit-rfc)
- [Prepare a release note](#prepare-a-release-note)
- [Create calendar appointment](#create-calendar-appointment)
- [Send email](#send-email)

## Agree date and time for release

For a standard release which does not require any downtime, makes no major changes to functionality, and just requires web-ops to click a button you can determine the date and time with little to no collaboration. Things to note

- avoid Fridays (web-ops and Change Management don't like them!)
- go for an AM release (this gives more time should something go wrong)
- pre-check the calendar for the web-ops and QA leads

This should also take into account the type of change being requested.

- **Normal** - release in 10 working days time or later
  - Approvals are sought by email by the Change management team before approving the RfC
- **Expedited** - release in 4-10 working days
  - The next Change Approval Board (CAB) will discuss the RfC . Someone from the team _may_ need to attend to answer any questions before they grant approval
- **Emergency** - release within 3 working days
  - An emergency CAB will convene to discuss the RfC. Someone from the team _will_ need to attend to answer any questions before they grant approval. These are _really_ discouraged by Change management and you _will_ be challenged on why it is needed.

If you need to co-ordinate the date and time for the release you will need to collaborate with these stakeholders.

- the CM team product owner as they will liaise with the business regime leads
- the CM team QA lead as they will need to be on hand to test the service after release
- web-ops as they perform all releases and updates to production environments

Unfortunately, until you actually submit the RfC it can be difficult to confirm exactly when the release will be. It has validation in place to ensure the change time frame is met. This is especially so with expedited and emergency changes as you will be endeavouring to find the earliest date and time possible!

## Submit RfC

Any service that is 'live' in Defra requires submitting a [Request for Change (RfC)](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/Checklist_Request_for_Change_RFC) before changing anything in production.

This applies to _all_ changes. Even something as small as changing the value of an environment variable requires an RfC!

The RfC needs to be approved by DDTS Change Management before you can proceed with the release.

Submit the RfC in [myIT](https://defra.service-now.com) (also known as **Service Now**). You'll need to be on the corporate network to access **myIT**. For those without a corporate laptop access from your phone is the only option ðŸ˜ž.

Check out [our RfC guide](/rfc/README.md) for help with doing this.

## Prepare a release note

To ensure everyone involved in shipping the release is clear on what actions are needed, prepare a [release note](https://gitlab-dev.aws-int.defra.cloud/open/release-notes).

There are plenty of existing ones to base it on covering a number of different types of 'release'. As an example, a simple update to the TCM would be

```markdown
# 06 April 2021

- CHG0049495
- No downtime required
- Scheduled 10am

## About this release

General patches and bug fixes.

## Release process

### Prior to release

- **web-ops** - Update property `DEPLOY_BRANCH=v3.1.0` in `PRD_03_TCM_DEPLOY` job in Jenkins

### Release day

- **web-ops** - `PRD_03_TCM_DEPLOY` job ran in Jenkins
- **delivery team** - Smoke test that service is up and operating as expected
```

## Create calendar appointment

Once a date and time has been confirmed create a calendar appointment and add the shared web-ops account **SM-Defra-ddts-aws-webops** and the CM team's QA as `required`. Add the rest of the CM tech team as `optional`. Use the following template for the title and content

```text
title: TCM RFC CHG0053007 v3.2.0

[Copy of release note content]

[Link to release note]
```

This will serve as both a confirmation and reminder to all of the agreed date and time.

## Send email

Create an email with approximately the following format and send to the regime leads (check with the team who they are as we don't want to include their emails in a public document). In `CC` add all members of the CM team.

```text
