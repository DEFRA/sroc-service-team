  operationId: CreateTestBillRun
  description: "This endpoint creates a test bill run for a region. It is intended for quickly creating large bill runs so we can assess the performance and operation of endpoints when working with them. You can control the type of invoices generated within the bill run using the request payload. The types are

  - `standard` - 3 debit lines in an invoice

  - `mixed-invoice` - 2 debit lines and 1 credit line resulting in an invoice

  - `mixed-credit` - 2 credit lines and 1 debit line resulting in a credit note

  - `zero-value` - 3 debit transactions all with a charge value of 0

  - `deminimis` - 3 debit transactions that total less than £5

  - `minimum-charge` - 3 debit transactions that total less than £25 and are all subject to minimum charge


  By default, every invoice created results in 3 transactions. So, the following request would result in a bill run with 100 invoices and 300 transactions.


  ```
  {
    \"region\": \"A\",
    \"mix\": [
        { \"type\": \"mixed-invoice\", \"count\": 40 },
        { \"type\": \"mixed-credit\", \"count\": 40 },
        { \"type\": \"zero-value\", \"count\": 10 },
        { \"type\": \"deminimis\", \"count\": 10 }
    ]
  }
  ```


  You can affect the number of transactions per invoice by including the `transactionMultiplier` property in the request payload. The followng request would result in 1 `mixed-invoice` with 50 debit lines and 25 credit lines.


  ```
  {
    \"region\": \"A\",
    \"transactionMultiplier\": 25,
    \"mix\": [
        { \"type\": \"mixed-invoice\", \"count\": 1 }
    ]
  }
  ```


  The endpoint has been designed to generate the bill run as quickly as possible. To do this we **do not** call the rules service. The values used are based on real calculations, but should the rules service calculation change it won't be reflected here.


  The endpoint returns the new bill run ID immediately, but may take sometime to create all the invoices. If you have access to it, check the log for a message that will confirm when the process is complete.
