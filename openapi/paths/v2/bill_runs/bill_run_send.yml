  operationId: SendBillRun
  description: |
    Triggers creation of a transaction file containing all transactions in the bill run. Bill run must be `approved` else the request will be rejected.

    ## Transaction import file

    Once a **bill run** has been 'generated' and 'approved' it can be 'sent' to SSCL SOP. When the 'send' endpoint is hit the CM will generate the transaction file for the specified **bill run**.

    The file contains the information SOP needs to generate invoices and credit notes for customers.

    ### Transaction file reference

    Each **bill run** is linked to a **regime** and region. Each combination has its own sequence counter. When a **bill run** is 'sent' the CM will generate a transaction file reference based on the **regime**, region and next sequence counter. This will be assigned to the **bill run** and its status will be updated to `pending`.

    The CM will then generate the transaction import file and transfer it to an AWS S3 bucket. From there it will be picked up by an [FME job](https://www.safe.com/fme/) which will grab the file and handle the transfer to a location accessible by SSCL SOP.

    Once transferred to the AWS S3 bucket the **bill run's** status will be updated to `billed`.

    > _If a bill run contains no chargeable invoices or credit notes, for example, because they are zero value, the status will be updated to `billing_not_required`_
