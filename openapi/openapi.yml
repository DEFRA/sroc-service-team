    ## Working with the API

    The [SRoC service team](https://github.com/DEFRA/sroc-service-team) use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) as the means to interact with the API. Check out their [docs](https://github.com/DEFRA/sroc-service-team/postman) for info on how to go about setting up your own Postman environment.

    ## Known issues

    ### Documentation

    ### API

    - Query params are case senstive. Ensure they match what is in the spec below to avoid `422 - Unprocessable Entity` errors
    - To generate a bill run summary you need to call the 'View Billrun' endpoint. The API curently appears to error doing this for ones with a large number of transactions (8-9K or more)
