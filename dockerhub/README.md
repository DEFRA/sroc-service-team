# Docker Hub

To allow users of the API to work with it locally and not rely on a connection to our AWS `INTEGRATION` environment we produce Docker container images.

> A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform. It provides a convenient way to package up applications and preconfigured server environments, which you can use for your own private use or share publicly with other Docker users.

We make these accessible on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

- Images for [Version 1 of the API](https://github.com/defra/charging-module-api) are at [environmentagency/charging-module-api](https://hub.docker.com/r/environmentagency/charging-module-api)
- Images for [Version 2 of the API](https://github.com/defra/sroc-charging-module-api) are at [environmentagency/sroc-charging-module-api](https://hub.docker.com/r/environmentagency/sroc-charging-module-api)

Along with the images we provide instructions on how to get up and running with them using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and a [makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile).

This folder is where we store a copy of the instructions and example files for each version.
