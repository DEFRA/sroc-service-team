# Request for Change (RfC)

Any service that is 'live' in Defra requires submitting a [Request for Change (RfC)](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/Checklist_Request_for_Change_RFC) before changing anything in production.

> [..] formal request for the implementation of a Change. The RFC is a precursor to the 'Change Record' and contains all information required to approve a Change.

This applies to _all_ changes. Even something as small as changing the value of an environment variable requires an RfC!

Submit your RfC in [myIT](https://defra.service-now.com) (also known as **Service Now**). You'll need to be on the corporate network to access **myIT**. For those without a corporate laptop access from your phone is the only option ðŸ˜ž.

## Time frames

There are 3 types of RfC. The key differentiators are

- the lead time before you can apply the change
- the approval process it goes through

Expedited and emergency changes are used only as a last resort.

### Normal

Have a 10 working day lead time. Approvals are sought by email by the Change management team before approving the RfC.

### Expedited

For changes that need implementing in 4 to 10 days. The next Change Approval Board (CAB) will discuss the RfC. Someone from the team will need to attend to answer any questions before they grant approval.

### Emergency

For changes that need implementing in 1 to 3 days. An emergency CAB will convene to discuss the RfC. Someone from the team will need to attend to answer any questions before they grant approval.

These are really discouraged by Change management and you _will_ be challenged on why it is needed.

## Submitting an RfC

### Permission to submit

To submit an RfC you'll need a higher access level in myIT than the standard provided to most staff. You can request this from the myIT home page by going to `Get Help -> Outdated Applications` and completing the form. Be sure to detail the need to raise all types of RfC (not just **normal**). The form does ask your line managers details and a cost code (there is a licensing cost involved) so double check first if you actually need it. Others on the team may already have responsibility for submitting RfC's covered.

### Filling in the form

The form is (currently) accessed from the menu `Change -> Create New`. It's here you'll select the type of change required (**normal**, **expedited** or **emergency**). The form is the same for each, though if you're not requesting a **normal** change be sure to add additional detail to justify the request.

We have provided examples of completed RfC's for each service which can also be used as the basis for new ones. Check out each for specific details on the form itself.

- [SROC Charging Module API](/rfc/cha.md)
- [SROC Tactical Charging Module](/rfc/tcm.md)

## When the RfC is completed

Though they'll have details on when the change will happen Change Management rely on teams letting them know when changes are complete and whether they were successful. Be sure to email `changeadministration@defra.gov.uk` once the change is applied.
